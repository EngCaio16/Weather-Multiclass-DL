Weather Type Classification using Deep Learning
This project explores a Deep Learning approach to multiclass classification on weather data, based on a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes multiple weather types, and the objective was to test the model’s ability to accurately classify various weather conditions.

Key Features:
Multiclass Classification: I implemented a Deep Learning model to handle the multiclass classification task for different weather types.
Categorical Crossentropy Loss: I used the categorical_crossentropy loss function with one-hot encoded target variables, as I wanted to experiment with the model’s performance when the target is represented as a vector.
Experiment: While I typically prefer traditional machine learning methods for structured data, this project was a study aimed at understanding how well Deep Learning could perform in such a scenario.
Model Implementation: Built with TensorFlow/Keras, the model consists of multiple layers designed to capture the complex relationships between features in the dataset.
Feel free to explore the code, dataset, and results. Any contributions or suggestions for improvement are welcome!
